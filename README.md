# DSC672
## About the Repo
This is a repository containing R and python scripts pertaining to the DSC672 group project on classifying car images using the Stanford Cars dataset.
## Table of Contents:
* Jitter plot of car model distribution across car model years (Shiny app)
* (More to come)
## Running Shiny Apps
Currently, running the jitter plot app (DSC672/ModelApp) using runGitHub() is not working. Therefore, users must clone the repository first and run it on RStudio. To do this, first open RStudios in the folder containing the Shiny app. Then, enter the following into the RStudio console:
    library(shiny)
    runApp()
